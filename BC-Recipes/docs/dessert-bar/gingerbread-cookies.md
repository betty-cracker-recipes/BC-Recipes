# Gingerbread Cookie Recipe
Soft gingerbread cookies, perfect for Winter holidays.

## Ingredients:
- 3 Cups Flour
- 1/4 tsp. Salt
- 2 tsp. Ginger	
- 1 tsp. Cinnamon			
- 1/4 tsp. Nutmeg
- 1 tsp. Baking Soda
- 3/4 Cup Brown Sugar, firmly packed	
- 3/4 Cup Butter, softened
- 1/2 Cup Molasses	
- 1 Egg
- 1 tsp. Vanilla Extract

## Preparation:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
 
## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter for 1 minute on medium speed until completely smooth and creamy. Add the brown sugar and molasses and beat on medium high speed until combined and creamy-looking. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Next, beat in egg and vanilla on high speed for 2 full minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. The butter may separate; that’s ok.
 
2. In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves together until combined. On low speed, slowly mix into the wet ingredients until combined. The cookie dough will be quite thick and slightly sticky. Divide dough in half and place each onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Wrap each up tightly and pat down to create a disc shape. Please see photo and description above in my post. Chill discs for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory for this cookie dough. I always chill mine overnight.
 
3. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.) Set aside.

4. Remove 1 disc of chilled cookie dough from the refrigerator. Generously flour a work surface, as well as your hands and the rolling pin. Don’t be afraid to continually flour the work surface as needed- this dough can be sticky. Roll out disc until 1/4-inch thick. Cut into shapes. Place shapes 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Re-roll dough scraps until all the dough is shaped. Repeat with remaining disc of dough.
 
5. Bake cookies for about 9-10 minutes. If your cookie cutters are smaller than 4 inches, bake for about 8 minutes. If your cookie cutters are larger than 4 inches, bake for about 11 minutes. My oven has hot spots and yours may too- so be sure to rotate the pan once during bake time.
 
6. Allow cookies to cool for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet. Transfer to cooling rack to cool completely. Once completely cool, decorate as desired.
 
7. Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.

# Gingerbread Cookie Frosting
A light glaze, sweetens and keeps cookies moist.

## Ingredients
- 3 Cups Powdered Sugar, sifted
- 3-4 tbsp. Milk
- 2 tbsp. Light Corn Syrup
- 1/2 tsp. Vanilla Extract

## Instructions:
1. Combine sugar, 2 Tablespoons of milk, corn syrup, and vanilla extract in a medium-sized bowl and stir until combined. If frosting is too thick, add more milk, about a teaspoon at a time, until the frosting is thick but pipeable. If you accidentally add too much milk, add powdered sugar until desired texture is reached.  

2. If coloring the frosting, divide into bowls and color as desired at this point.

3. Transfer frosting to a piping bag with a piping tip (I used Wilton 5), or place in a Ziploc bag and snip a small piece of the corner off (not as neat, but this will still work, just take care that the frosting isn’t so thick that it breaks open the seam of the bag when you are squeezing).  

4. Pipe frosting on cookies and decorate with decorative candies, if desired.

5. Allow frosting to harden before enjoying (this took several hours for me and may vary for you depending on the consistency of your frosting)

6. Keep uneaten cookies sealed in an airtight container at room temperature.
