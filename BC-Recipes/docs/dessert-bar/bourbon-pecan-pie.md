# Bourbon Pecan Pie
 Rich chocolate bourbon pecan pie.

## Ingredients
- 2 cups pecans
- 3 large eggs
- ¾ cup dark brown sugar
- ⅔ cup light corn syrup
- 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract
- 2 tbsp. unsalted butter (melted)
- 4 tbsp. bourbon
- ½ tsp. salt
- 1/2 cup semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips

## Preparation
- Preheat the oven to 375°F

## Instructions
1. Fold crust into 9 inch pan
2. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs with the brown sugar, corn syrup, vanilla, melted butter, bourbon and salt until blended.
3. Stir in the chopped pecans and chocolate chips until evenly distributed.
4. Pour the filling into the pie shell. Bake on the bottom shelf of the oven for about 55 minutes, or until the center of the pie is set. Tent the crust with foil halfway through the baking time if the edge is browning too quickly.
5. Transfer the pie to a rack and let cool for at least 1 hour before serving.
