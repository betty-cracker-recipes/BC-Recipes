# Sugar Cookies
Sugar cookies that can be rolled out for any cookie cutter and taste great.

### Ingredients
- 1 Cup Unsalted Butter, softened to room temperature
- 1 Cup Sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp. Vanilla Extract
- 1 large egg
- 2 1/2 Cups Flour
- 3/4 tsp. baking powder
- 1/2 tsp. Salt

#### Preparation
- Preheat oven to 350F

### Instructions
1. Combine butter and sugar in the bowl with an electric hand mixer and beat until creamy and well-combined.
2. Add egg and vanilla extract and beat until completely combined.
3. In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.
4. Gradually add dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until completely combined.
5. Lay out a large piece of plastic wrap and transfer approximately half of the dough onto the wrap.
6. Cover with clear wrap and mold into a disk.  Repeat with remaining cookie dough in another piece of cling wrap.  Transfer dough to refrigerator and chill for at least 2-3 hours.
7. Once dough has finished chilling, preheat the oven to 350Fand line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Set aside.
8. Generously dust a clean surface with flour and deposit one chilled cookie dough disk onto the surface.  Lightly flour the dough and roll out to 1/8" (for thinner, crispier cookies) or 1/4" (for thicker, softer cookies).  Continue to add flour as needed both on top of and beneath the dough so that it doesn't stick.
9. Use cookie cutters to cut out shapes and use a spatula to transfer shapes to prepared baking sheet.
10. Bake on 350F for 9-10 minutes, or until edges just begin to turn lightly golden brown.
11. Allow cookies to cool completely on the cookie sheet before moving and frosting.

# Royal Icing with Meringue Powder

Easy to work with frosting that uses meringue powder in place of eggs, making it store better and set easier. [Domino Sugar's Classic Buttercream Frosting](https://www.dominosugar.com/recipe/buttercream-frosting) also works well with these.

### Ingredients
- 4 Cup Confectioners’ Sugar, sifted
- 3 tbsp. Meringue Powder
- 8–10 tbsp. Water, room temp
- Food Coloring, optional

### Instructions
 1. In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat all of the icing ingredients together on high speed for 5 minutes, starting with 8 tablespoons of water.
 2. When lifting the whisk up off the icing, the icing should drizzle down and smooth out within 10-15 seconds.
 3. If it’s too thick, add a little more water. Uf it’s too thin, add a little more sifted confectioners’ sugar.
