  - ½ Cup Butter
  - ¼ Cup Shortening
  - 2 tsp. Anise Extract
  - 4 Eggs
  - 3 Cups Flour
  - 5 tsp. Baking Powder

  2. Add to the creamed mixture gradually. If the dough is too sticky to roll in the palm of your hand add flour until firmer, but it should be very soft
 
  3. Roll dough into small balls (they’ll puff up a lot) and place in ungreased cookie sheets
 
  4. Bake at 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes (bottoms should be slightly brown, but tops will remain light).Let cool completely before glazing.
