# Italian Anisette Cookies
Frosted liquorice flavored cookies.

### Ingredients
  - ½ cup Butter
  - ¼ cup Shortening
  - 2 tsp. Anise Extract
  - 4 Large Eggs
  - 3 cups All-Purpose Flour
  - 5 tsp. Baking Powder
  - ¾ cup Granulated Sugar		
  - ½ tsp. Salt	


#### Preparation
  - Preheat the oven to 375°F.

### Instructions
  1. Melt butter & shortening together. Add the sugar, mix well. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the anise extract. Sift or whisk together flour, baking powder and salt.

  2. Add to the creamed mixture gradually. If the dough is too sticky to roll in the palm of your hand add flour until firmer, but it should be very soft.

  3. Roll dough into small balls (they’ll puff up a lot) and place in ungreased cookie sheets.

  4. Bake at 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes (bottoms should be slightly brown, but tops will remain light).Let cool completely before glazing.

# Anisette Cookie Glaze
  A light glaze for a sweeter taste, while the frosting is drying the cookies can also top with sprinkles.

  ### Glaze Ingredients:
  - 2 cups Confectioners' Sugar
  - 2-4 tbsp. Milk

 ### Glaze Instructions:
  1. Slowly add milk to confectioners' sugar until preferred consistency is reached (the glaze may run off the sides of the cookie when frosted).
